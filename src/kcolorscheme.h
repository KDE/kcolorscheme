 * \class KColorScheme
 * \inmodule KColorScheme
 * \brief A set of methods used to work with colors.
 *
 * KColorScheme currently provides access to the system color palette that the
 * user has selected (in the future, it is expected to do more).  It greatly
 * expands on QPalette by providing five distinct "sets" with several color
 * choices each, covering background, foreground, and decoration colors.
 *
 * A KColorScheme instance represents colors corresponding to a "set", where a
 * set consists of those colors used to draw a particular type of element, such
 * as a menu, button, view, selected text, or tooltip. Each set has a distinct
 * set of colors, so you should always use the correct set for drawing and
 * never assume that a particular foreground for one set is the same as the
 * foreground for any other set. Individual colors may be quickly referenced by
 * creating an anonymous instance and invoking a lookup member.
 *
 * \note
 * The color palettes for the various states of a widget (active, inactive,
 * disabled) may be wildly different.  Therefore, it is important to take the
 * state into account. This is why the KColorScheme constructor requires a
 * QPalette::ColorGroup as an argument.
 *
 * To facilitate working with potentially-varying states, two convenience API's
 * are provided. These are KColorScheme::adjustBackground and its sister
 * KColorScheme::adjustForeground, and the helper class KStatefulBrush.
 *
 * \sa KColorScheme::ColorSet, KColorScheme::ForegroundRole,
 * KColorScheme::BackgroundRole, KColorScheme::DecorationRole,

     * \enum KColorScheme::ColorSet
     *
     * This enumeration describes the color set for which a color is being
     * selected.
     *
     * Color sets define a color "environment", suitable for drawing all parts
     * of a given region. Colors from different sets should not be combined.
     *
     * \value View Views; for example, frames, input fields, etc.\br\br
     *             If it contains things that can be selected, it is probably a \c View.
     * \value Window Non-editable window elements; for example, menus.\br\br
     *               If it isn't a \c Button, \c View, or \c Tooltip, it is probably a \c Window.
     * \value Button Buttons and button-like controls.\br\br
     *               In addition to buttons, "button-like" controls such as non-editable
     *               dropdowns, scrollbar sliders, slider handles, etc. should also use
     *               this role.
     * \value Selection Selected items in views.\br\br
     *                  Note that unfocused or disabled selections should use the \c Window
     *                  role. This makes it more obvious to the user that the view
     *                  containing the selection does not have input focus.
     * \value Tooltip Tooltips.\br\br
     *                The tooltip set can often be substituted for the view
     *                set when editing is not possible, but the Window set is deemed
     *                inappropriate. "What's This" help is an excellent example, another
     *                might be pop-up notifications (depending on taste).
     *                Deprecated, use tooltip colors from QPalette.
     * \value [since KColorScheme 5.19] Complementary Complementary areas.\br\br
     *                                  Some applications want some areas to have a different color scheme.
     *                                  Usually dark areas over a light theme. For instance the fullscreen UI
     *                                  of a picture viewer, or the logout/lock screen of the plasma workspace
     *                                  ask for a dark color scheme even on light themes.

     * be used to draw text. In combination with one of the overloads of

     * frames, bevels, and similar decorations.

     *                            This color may be the same as \c BackgroundNormal, especially in sets
     *                            other than \c View and \c Window.
     * \value ActiveBackground Third color; for example, items which are new, active, requesting
     *                         attention, etc.\br\br
     *                         Alerting the user that a certain field must be filled out would be a
     *                         good usage (although NegativeBackground could be used to the same

     *                         \c ActiveText, this should not be used for mouseover effects.

     *                       list). Deprecated, use regular background color, optionally tinted with QPalette link color
     * \value VisitedBackground Fifth color; corresponds to visited links.\br\br

     *                          "archival". Deprecated, use regular background color, optionally tinted with QPalette linkVisited color
     * \value NegativeBackground Sixth color; for example, errors, untrusted content, etc.
